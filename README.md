## 🏆 Senior Product Manager | Discovery & Exploration Generalist

I thrive as the generalist in the room - connecting dots, herding cats, and synthesizing information to drive meaningful product outcomes.

---

### 🚀 What I Do

- **Product Leadership:** Senior Product Manager passionate about making an impact through discovery, exploration, actionable information synthesis, and sifting through the details to uncover hidden insights.
- **Generalism:** I excel at being the "cat herder" - bridging gaps across domains, leading cross-functional teams, and turning ambiguity into clarity. My secret super power is curiosity. My cross to bear is short attention span. Which is why I specialise in being a generalist.
- **Pet Projects:** Creator of [Cat Flap Stats](https://github.com/mannepanne/cat-flap-stats), biomonitoring analysis for my feline companion, Sven the Cat. Quite literally, in the truly literal sense of the word, a pet project.

### 🛠️ Favorite Tools & Hobbies

- **Coding** (with Claude and Gemini CLI)
- **Reading** (mainly Sci-Fi, but also non fiction about the human condition, politics and history)
- **Gaming** (strategy, adventures, and digital storytelling)
- **Dining** (a decade in restaurant reservations hooked me on great restaurant experiences for life)
